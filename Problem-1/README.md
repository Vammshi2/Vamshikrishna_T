# Simple Calculator Using Class (OOP Based)

## Description

This project demonstrates a basic **Calculator** implemented using the concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The calculator performs four fundamental operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### Logic

- The class takes two inputs `a` and `b` (both of type `double`/`float`)
- A third input is taken as a string to represent the `operation` (e.g., `"add"`, `"subtract"`)
- Based on the type of operation, the corresponding method is executed

## Supported Languages

- ✅ Python 3

> **Note:** As the test allows _"any programming language"_, the submitted solution is written in **Python**, with clear inline comments explaining each section.
